# Brainstation_final_project
This is a final project for BrainStation's data science certification. Brainstation's data science course gives an opportunities to learn the foundations of data science, how to create dynamic data visualizations, data modeling, machine learning techniques, Python for data analysis and so on. 

In the final project, I used ifood marketing campaign data that is publicly available and can be found in https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jackdaoud/marketing-data. 

The goal of this project here is to build a model to predict customers' behaviour and trend in spending to succeed the future marketing campaigns. Various machine learning models are used to predict the customers' response to the marketing campaigns and evaluated for their accuracy.
